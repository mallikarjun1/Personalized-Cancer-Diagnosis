# Personalized-Cancer-Diagnosis
There are nine different classes a genetic mutation can be classified into => Multi class classification problem; Performance metrics considered: Multi-class log-loss and Confusion Matrix.
Applied the Models with TF-IDF features using tfidfvectorizer().
Used top 3000 words based on tf-idf values.
1. Naive Bayes with One Hot Encoding; 2. KNN with Response Coding; 3. Logistic Regression with Class Balancing and without Class Balancing and with Count vectorizer features, including both unigram and bigrams i.e ngram_range(1, 4); 4. Random Forest with One Hot Encoding and with Response coding; 5. Stacking all the models with One Hot Encoding; 6. Maximum Voting Classifier with One Hot Encoding;
Applied Feature Engineering on Logistic Regression
